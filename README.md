# AdventOfCode_2024

In the year 2022 I discovered the wonderful realm of advent of code.
It was introduced to me by a co-worker and 2022 was my first time
giving the challenges a try. 

In 2020 I started a new job in the tech industry. I did not know how to 
program, but had a strong desire to learn. My dream after high school 
was to learn how to program, but due to the cost of school, and life 
circumstances, I ended up getting into the logging industry. Now that I
was given this opportunity I took my chance. I self-taught myself how to
write code in C and within 6 months of starting at this company moved into
a junior programming role.

In the year 2023 I moved into the position of team lead and then at the end
of the year into a senior software developer role.

Due to working with embedded microprocessors, I work mostly in C/C++. And prior
to becoming aware of advent of code, C was the only language I was proficient
at. I decided in 2022 that I would use advent of code to learn other frameworks
and languages hopefully expand my horizons. Each year I will either try a new
language or pick one where I need improvement. I may even go back and do prior 
years if time permits (I have two small kids).

Anyway, this is the backstory behind my journey as a software developer and my
goals with advent of code.
