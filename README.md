# AdventOfCode_2024

In the year 2022 I discovered the wonderful realm of advent of code.
It was introduced to me by a co-worker and 2022 was my first time
giving the challenges a try. 

In 2020 I started a new job in the tech industry. I did not know how to 
program, but had a strong desire to learn. My dream after high school 
was to learn how to program, but due to the cost of school, and life 
circumstances, I ended up getting into the logging industry. Now that I
was given this opportunity I took my chance. I self-taught myself how to
write code in C and within 6 months of starting at this company moved into
a junior programming role.

In the year 2023 I moved into the position of team lead and then at the end
of the year into a senior software developer role.

Due to working with embedded microprocessors, I work mostly in C/C++. And prior
to becoming aware of advent of code, C was the only language I was proficient
at. I decided in 2022 that I would use advent of code to learn other frameworks
and languages hopefully expand my horizons. Each year I will either try a new
language or pick one where I need improvement. I may even go back and do prior 
years if time permits (I have two small kids).

Anyway, this is the backstory behind my journey as a software developer and my
goals with advent of code.

### Year: 2024
### Language: C#


| Day  | Part1 | Part2 | Description                                                                                                                                             |
|------|-------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| #1   | [X]   | [X]   | Easy difficultly. I parsed the string into two lists and then calculated the required answers. Part 2 checks for similarity between lists. |
| #2   | [X]   | [X]   | Easy difficultly. I parsed the digits into a list and then tested the values against the requirements. Part 2 allows one bad value (adjustment to the requirements).   |
| #3   | [X]   | [X]   | Easy difficultly. I created methods that contain a switch statement to check the character and increment the stage. Part 2 adds additional instruction sets.   |
| #4   | [X]   | [X]   | Medium difficultly. For part 1 I used brute force to check every angle for the words. In part 2 I used a targeted check which could be completed in one pass   |
| #5   | [X]   | [X]   | Easy difficultly. I parsed the input into a Dictionary of rules and a list of page print order instructions. First you calculate the properly ordered instructions. Part 2 
                         fixes the incorrectly ordered instructions and calculates the answer.   |  
| #6   | [X]   | [X]   | Hard difficulty. I had a hard time with part 2 on this problem. You need to follow the path of the guard and calculate every possible position unique position he goes to 
                         for part 1. For part 2, you need to check every possible position you can place a obstical that will cause the guard to get stuck in a loop. My solution is brute force and 
                         not very effecient   |
